# Week 1: Introduction to Environmental Data Science in R


## Goals
This week you will be introduced to R, RStudio, R Markdown and GitHub. You will work through some R fundamentals, such as data types (including spatial data), reading and writing data, functions, packages and wrangling data with the `Tidyverse`. You will create a GitHub repo for this week's lesson content, write your code locally and practice committing and pushing your changes to GitHub.

## Resources
In addition to this week's lesson content, here are some useful and recommended resources for getting started with coding in R:


## Material/Assignmnet
Start with the [intro-basics](https://github.com/Data-Sci-Intro-2023/Week-1-Intro/blob/main/lessons/intro-basics.md) lesson, follow the instructions to create a GitHub repository and finish working through both that lesson along with the [intro-spatial](https://github.com/Data-Sci-Intro-2023/Week-1-Intro/blob/main/lessons/intro-spatial.md) lesson. You should try to complete the exercises in both lessons and save your answers in your Rmarkdown documents, but you will not be graded on them. This week you will only be graded on whether or not you created a GitHub respository and were able to push your code to the repo.


To complete this week's assignment go to the Issues tab in this repository and add the link to the repo you made on your personal GitHub account for this week's lesson.
