# Week-1-Intro

This repo contains lesson material for Week 1, located in the 'lessons' folder. Start with the (intro-basics)[] lesson, follow the instructions to create a GitHub repository and finish working through both the 'intro-basics' and 'intro-spatial' lessons. You should try to complete the exercises in both lessons and save your answers in your Rmarkdown documents, but you will not be graded on them. This week you will only be graded on whether or not you created a GitHub respository and were able to push your code to the repo.

To complete this week's assignment go to the 'Issues' tab in this repository and add the link to the repo you made on your personal GitHub account as a part of this week's lesson.
