# Week 1: Introduction to Environmental Data Science in R


## Goals
This week you will be introduced to R, RStudio, R Markdown and GitHub. You will work through some R fundamentals, such as data types in R (including spatial data), reading and writing data, functions, wrangling data with the `Tidyverse` and some basic data visualization. You will create your own GitHub repo for this week's lesson content, write your code locally (following along with the lessons posted below) and practice committing and pushing your changes to GitHub.

## Resources
In addition to this week's lesson content, here are some useful and recommended resources for getting started with coding in R:
- [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) (second edition)
- [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/index.html)
- [RStudio Education](https://education.rstudio.com/learn/beginner/): Lots of useful links for beginners on this page
- [Interactive tutorials from Posit (formerly RStudio)](https://posit.cloud/learn/primers): These tutorials were made using the `learnr` package and allow you to run R code directly from your browser


## Material/Assignment
Start with the [intro-basics](https://github.com/Data-Sci-Intro-2023/Week-1-Intro/blob/main/lessons/intro-basics.md) lesson, follow the instructions to create a GitHub repository and finish working through both that lesson along with the [intro-spatial](https://github.com/Data-Sci-Intro-2023/Week-1-Intro/blob/main/lessons/intro-spatial.md) lesson. You should try to complete the exercises in both lessons and save your answers in your Rmarkdown documents, but you will not be graded on them. 

This week you will be graded on:

- Creating your own GitHub repository as instructed and were able to push your code to the repo.
- Completing *most* of the lesson content in the [intro-basics](https://github.com/Data-Sci-Intro-2023/Week-1-Intro/blob/main/lessons/intro-basics.md) and [intro-spatial](https://github.com/Data-Sci-Intro-2023/Week-1-Intro/blob/main/lessons/intro-spatial.md) lessons. (Again, try to complete all the exercises, but they will not be graded).

**To complete this week's assignment go to the [Issues](https://github.com/Data-Sci-Intro-2023/Week-1-Intro/issues/1) for this repository and add the link to the repo you made on your personal GitHub account.**

**Due: End of the day Wed 1/25**
